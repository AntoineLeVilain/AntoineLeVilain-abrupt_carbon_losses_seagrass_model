This repository contains the code used to conduct the figures of: Abrupt loss of soil organic carbon following disturbance in seagrass ecosystems. Each figure from the related study has its own folder, which includes the necessary scripts to rerun simulations, the output of those simulations, and the code to plot the results. By navigating to any figureâ€™s folder, you can reproduce the simulations and visualise the results. The repository is organised to facilitate reproducibility and further exploration of the ecosystem model and its behavior under various scenarios.

We performed our analysis using R version 3.6.3.

Do not forget to add your working directory if you want to save the figures.
